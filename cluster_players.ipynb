    "\n",
    "* You may notice that the results change if you run it multiple times - this is by design. Even if you set a random seed, by default the algorithm is going to run the clustering multiple times and return the \"best\" result. \n",

    "    * Elite Assisters (AST > 5, like Natasha Cloud and Courtney Vandersloot)\n",
    "    * 3-Point Specialists (3P > 2, like Jewel Loyd and Sabrina Ionescu)\n",
    "    * Bigs who block (BLK > 1, like Brittney Griner and Aliyah Boston)\n",
    "    * Bigs who play like forwards (AST > 3, 3P > 1, like Stewie and A'ja Wilson)\n",
    "* When you don't have the optimal number of clusters, sometimes you'll get a messy overlap of groups; I've seen elite assisters come up but its size is only, say, 5 players when they'd probably fit in fine with the 3-Point Specialists in general who also have higher (but not quite as high) assist values\n",
    "* If I did this again, I'd probably try to normalize the stats by minutes played because I don't like that a common group is simply players who play less minutes and have generally lower magnitude stats overall"
